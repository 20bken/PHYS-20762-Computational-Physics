# PHYS20762-Computational-Physics

This repository contains all the computational physics projects Kento Shiba completed when he was in 2nd year, 2023. The final grade achieved in this course was 81% with the UK grading scale. Attached here are Projects 2 and 3, which counted towards the final grade.

## Assessment methods
Students carry out 3 short projects (as an individual, not in a pair or group). Projects 2 and 3 count equally towards the final grade whereas project 1 is only formative, but requires a sufficient level of coding proficiency. Students are expected to show creativity in adapting the course to real life applications.

## Feedback methods
Feedback for coding was given orally by demonstrators during lab sessions with additional written feedback provided with the mark for each project. 

Dr. Saeed Bahramy - Unit coordinator
Dr. Draga Pihler-Puzovic - Unit coordinator

This course was used to teach the techniques of computational physics and dynamic high-level scripting programming languages.
 
## On completion, students should be able to:
 
1. Write programs using dynamic high-level scripting programming languages and carry out data analysis in them.
2. Use classical numerical methods (Euler and higher order) to find solutions of ordinary differential equations.
3. Use Monte Carlo techniques and associated statistical methods.
4. Use numerical solutions to analyse the behaviour of a physical system (such as a driven oscillator).

## Project 1:
### 1. Use of high-level scripting language for data analysis.
<br> a) Definitions of variables and arrays; scalar and array operations; built in and user-defined functions; </br>
<br> b) Working with data sets: file input / output. Data visualization and plotting; </br>
<br> c) Revision of error analysis: X2 analysis, errors on fitting coefficients, propagation of errors; </br>
<br> d) Fitting functions onto existing nonlinear behaviour datasets </br>
 
## Project 2:
### 2. Numerical methods and the solution of ordinary differential equations
<br>a) Introduction to numerical computing; errors in numerical methods. </br>
<br>b) Numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations; Eulerâ€™s method; higher order methods, symplectic methods; </br>
<br>c) Implementation of numerical methods. </br>
<br>d) The linear driven damped oscillator; phase space; conserved quantities; sources of simulation error. </br>
 
## Project 3:
### 3. The Monte Carlo method and its applications.
<br>a) Introduction to Monte Carlo methods; Monte Carlo integration; classical problems;</br>
<br>b) Pseudorandom sampling; methods of generating samples with given probability density;</br>
<br>c) Applications of Monte Carlo methods;</br>
<br>d) Statistical errors.</br>
